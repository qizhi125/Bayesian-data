Iris Classification with Naive Bayes


A Python implementation of the Naive Bayes algorithm for classifying iris flowers based on their sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width.

Installation

This code requires the following packages:

	scikit-learn
	pandas

To install these packages, run:

	pip install scikit-learn pandas

Usage

To run the code, simply clone the repository and run the ‘iris_classification.py’ file:

	python iris_classification.py

This will train a Naive Bayes model on the iris data set and output the accuracy of the model on a held-out test set.

Data Set

The iris data set is a classic data set for classification tasks. It contains 150 samples of iris flowers, with 50 samples each of three different species: setosa, versicolor, and virginica. Each sample has four features: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width. The data set is stored in the file ‘iris-change.csv’.

Algorithm

The Naive Bayes algorithm is a probabilistic algorithm that uses Bayes' theorem to compute the probability of a sample belonging to a particular class. In the case of iris classification, the algorithm computes the probability that a given set of sepal and petal measurements belongs to each of the three iris species, and then selects the species with the highest probability as the predicted class.

Results

After training the Naive Bayes model on the iris data set and testing it on a held-out test set, the model achieved an accuracy of 93.33%.

Acknowledgments

The iris data set was originally published by Ronald Fisher in 1936 and has since become a classic data set in machine learning. This implementation of the Naive Bayes algorithm was inspired by the scikit-learn library.
